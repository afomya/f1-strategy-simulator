# 🏎️ Race Architect: F1 Strategy Simulator & Driver Performance Model

A data science project simulating and optimizing Formula 1 race strategies under uncertainty.  
The goal is to build a modular, reproducible engine for:

- 🛠 Tire degradation modeling
- 🧠 Race strategy optimization under stochastic conditions
- 👨‍✈️ Driver skill estimation controlling for car/team/circuit
- 📊 Dashboards to visualize simulation outcomes and performance metrics

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Learn data science deeply by building a complex, end-to-end system
- Practice production-grade workflows: version control, reporting, testing
- Showcase skills in simulation, modeling, visualization, and MLOps
  
---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- `FastF1`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `streamlit`
- Version control via `git`, with GitHub for collaboration and issue tracking
